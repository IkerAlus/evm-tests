### EVM Tests [WIP]

Set of generic tests to check for chain compatibility. It covers higher level 
tests derived from Smart Contracts (such as Uniswap V3) and lower level testing inspired by [`Matter Labs`]
(https://github.com/matter-labs).

## Execution

To run the tests, simply run the script `init.sh`:

```sh
~ ./init.sh
```
This will install the necessary packages and run the tests in order.
